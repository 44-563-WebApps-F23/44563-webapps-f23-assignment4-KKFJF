    <h6><p class="misstesman">MISS TESMAN</p></h6>

        <p class="speech misstesman">Yes, Hedda, here I am, in mourning and forlorn; for now my poor sister
        has at last found peace.</p>
        
        
        <h6><p class="hedda">HEDDA</p></h6>
        
        <p class="speech hedda">I have heard the news already, as you see. Tesman sent me a card.</p>
        
        
        <h6><p class="misstesman">MISS TESMAN</p></h6>
        
        <p class="speech misstesman">Yes, he promised me he would. But nevertheless I thought that to
        Hedda--here in the house of life--I ought myself to bring the tidings of
        death.</p>
        
        
        <h6><p class="hedda">HEDDA</p></h6>
        
        <p class="speech hedda">That was very kind of you.</p>
        
        
        <h6><p class="misstesman">MISS TESMAN</p></h6>
        
        <p class="speech misstesman">Ah, Rina ought not to have left us just now. This is not the time for
        Hedda's house to be a house of mourning.</p>

        <p style="color:red;" class="direction">[.Changing the subject]</p> <p class="speech hedda"> She died quite peacefully, did she not, Miss
        Tesman?</p>
        
        
        <h6><p class="misstesman">MISS TESMAN</p></h6>
        
        <p class="speech misstesman">Oh, her end was so calm, so beautiful. And then she had the unspeakable
        happiness of seeing George once more--and bidding him good-bye.--Has he
        not come home yet?
        </p>

        <h6><p class="hedda">HEDDA</p></h6>

        <p class="speech hedda">No. He wrote that he might be detained. But won't you sit down?</p>


        <h6><p class="misstesman">MISS TESMAN<p></h6>

        <p class="speech misstesman">No thank you, my dear, dear Hedda. I should like to, but I have so much
        to do. I must prepare my dear one for her rest as well as I can. She
        shall go to her grave looking her best.</p>


        <h6><p class="hedda">HEDDA.</h6>
        <p class="speech hedda">Can I not help you in any way?</p>


        <h6><p class="misstesman">MISS TESMAN</h6>

        <P class="speech misstesman">Oh, you must not think of it! Hedda Tesman must have no hand in such
        mournful work. Nor let her thought dwell on it either--not at this time.</P>


        <h6><p class="hedda">HEDDA</h6>
        <p class="speech hedda">One is not always mistress of one's thoughts--</p>

        <p style=color:red; class="direction">[Continuing.]</p> <p class="speech misstesman">Ah yes, it is the way of the world. At home we shall be
        sewing a shroud; and here there will soon be sewing too, I suppose--but
        of another sort, thank God!</p>
