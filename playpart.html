    <h2>Hedda Gabler - Henrik Ibsen</h2>
    <p><b>MISS TESMAN</b>

        Yes, Hedda, here I am, in mourning and forlorn; for now my poor sister
        has at last found peace.
        
        
        <b>HEDDA</b>
        
        I have heard the news already, as you see. Tesman sent me a card.
        
        
        <b>MISS TESMAN</b>
        
        Yes, he promised me he would. But nevertheless I thought that to
        Hedda--here in the house of life--I ought myself to bring the tidings of
        death.
        
        
        <b>HEDDA</b>
        
        That was very kind of you.
        
        
        <b>MISS TESMAN</b>
        
        Ah, Rina ought not to have left us just now. This is not the time for
        Hedda's house to be a house of mourning.
        
        
        <b>HEDDA</b>
        
        <b>[Changing the subject]</b> She died quite peacefully, did she not, Miss
        Tesman?
        
        
        <b>MISS TESMAN</b>
        
        Oh, her end was so calm, so beautiful. And then she had the unspeakable
        happiness of seeing George once more--and bidding him good-bye.--Has he
        not come home yet?
